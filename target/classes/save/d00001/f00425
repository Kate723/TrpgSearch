<div class="inner" id="msg_598269"><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Character Creation</span><br>To play in a game of Dragon Age, you must first make a character. This is your alter ego in the land of Thedas, the persona you’ll be taking on as you experience ex¬citing and perilous adventures. Since your character is the focus of your play experience, making the right character for you is quite important. If you end up with a character you find unappealing or who isn’t fun to play, your enjoyment of the game will dimin¬ish. So don’t be afraid to take some time and put some thought into creating your character. This chapter explains the whole process and provides examples so you can see how it’s done. When you are finished, you’ll have a character ready to play. <br>The first time you read this chapter, you will come across rules and terms you don’t understand yet. Don’t panic. You’ll learn everything you need to know as you work your way through the Player’s Guide, and you’ll want to at least skim the whole book before you sit down to make a character. Also remember that there is a glossary at the back of the book. You can look up important terms there at any time. <br>Before you start making a character, you will need a character sheet. You’ll use this record to keep track of your character’s various abilities and powers. There is a blank character sheet on the back of this book, or you can download a PDF version from <a href="http://www.greenronin.com" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">www.greenronin.com</a>. <br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Making a Character in 8 Easy Steps </span> <br>Making a Dragon Age character is a straightforward process that you can complete in eight easy steps. The steps are listed here, and the rest of the chapter covers each step in order. <br>1. Createa character concept. This is a rough idea of the sort of character you’d like to play. See the following section. <br>2. Determineabilities. These are your character’s core physical and mental attributes. See page 19. <br>3. Choosea background. This represents your culture and upbringing, and also determines your race (dwarf, elf, or human). See page 20. <br>4. Choosea class. This is your character’s calling in life. You can choose mage, rogue, or warrior. See page 26.<br><br>5. Pick equipment. Your character needs gear before the adventures begin. See page 30. <br>6. CalculateDefenseand Speed. Both are very important in combat. See page 31. <br>7. Pick a name. Every hero needs a good name! See page 31. <br>8. Choosegoalsand character ties. They help give your character personality. See page 32.<br></div>

<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_598271"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Character Concept </span> <br>Before you sit down to make a character, you should learn a little bit about the setting. If you haven’t yet read Chapter 1: Welcome to Ferelden, take a look at that now. If you are already familiar with Ferelden from the Dragon Age: Origins computer game, so much the better. <br>Now that you know more about the setting, you can start thinking about what kind of character you want to play. You’ll be making the two most important choic¬es—your background and class—in steps 3 of 4 of char¬acter creation, but before you get there it’s a good idea to come up with a basic character concept. This can be quite broad to start; the process of character creation will help you focus it. <br>When coming up with a character concept, remember that one of the conceits of the game is that your char¬acter begins as an unknown and struggling adventurer. You don’t get to start play as the crown prince or an archmage. You have to earn your honors with deeds, and you can be sure there will be a price. So start think¬ing about who your character is and how he became an adventurer. Here are some example character concepts: <br>A guttersnipe raised on the streets who’ll do • anything to survive. <br>A free spirit who fled from an arranged marriage • for a life of adventure. <br>A naïve farmer who wants to travel farther than 5 • miles from where he was born. <br>The child of a disgraced knight who wants to • return honor to the family name. <br>A cynical mercenary who trusts little but coin. • <br>A seeker of forbidden knowledge who often acts • before thinking. <br>An artist seeking inspiration in dark and • dangerous places. <br>A refugee from a village that was sacked and • destroyed. <br>A child of the forest more comfortable around • animals than people. <br>The scion of a merchant family who wants more • from life than ledger books. <br>Example <br>Kate and her friends are starting a Dragon Age campaign, so she must make a character. Hav¬ing read Chapter 1, she decides to play a char¬acter with a crusading spirit and a keen sense of justice, probably from the lower rungs of soci¬ety. She’s a little light on the details for starters, but these basic ideas will guide her as she cre¬ates her character and you can follow along in examples throughout this chapter.<br><br></div>

<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_598272"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Abilities </span> <br>Your character is defined by eight abilities: Commu¬nication, Constitution, Cunning, Dexterity, Magic, Perception, Strength, and Willpower. Taken together these abilities map out your character’s strengths and weaknesses. You determine your abilities random¬ly by rolling dice, giving each one a numeric rating ranging from –2 to 4. A –2 is quite poor while a 4 is outstanding; a 1 is average. The higher the ability, the better. During play your abilities can increase as you gain experience and learn how to better harness your natural aptitudes. <br>Abilities are a key component of the game and you’ll be using them frequently. You’ll find it useful to un¬derstand the nature of each ability, so descriptions of them follow. <br>• Communication covers your character’s social skills, personal interactions, and ability to deal with others. <br>• Constitution is your character’s fortitude and resistance to harm. <br>• Cunningis a measure of your character’s intelligence, knowledge, and education. <br>• Dexterity encompasses agility, hand-eye coordination, and quickness. <br>• Magic determines your character’s innate arcane power. <br>• Perception covers all the senses and the ability to interpret sensory data. <br>• Strength is your character’s physical prowess. <br>• Willpower encompasses mental toughness, discipline, and confidence.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Determining Abilities</span> <br>You roll dice to determine your starting abilities. You will need three 6-sided dice (3d6). Roll all three and add them together to get a result. If you rolled 3, 4, and 6, for example, your result would be 13 (3 + 4 + 6 = 13). <br>You need to make eight of these rolls all together, one per ability. On your character sheet, you’ll notice a sec¬tion for abilities that begins with Communication and ends with Willpower. Starting at the top with Commu¬nication, make a dice roll, and consult the Determining Abilities table to determine your starting ability. A roll of 11 on the chart, for example, means the ability’s start¬ing score is 1. Once you’ve recorded Communication, move on to Constitution, and then so on down the list until all eight abilities have starting scores. <br>When you are done, you may swap any two of the abili¬ties. This gives you a chance to customize your abilities a bit. <br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Example </span> <br>Kate must now roll for her character’s starting abilities. She rolls 3d6 and gets a 13. Looking at the chart, Kate sees this gives her character a starting score of 2 on her first ability (Com¬munication). Kate makes seven more dice rolls, getting 5, 16, 8, 11, 6, 11, and 15. Her character’s starting abilities are thus Communication 2, Constitution -1, Cunning 0, Dexterity 3, Magic 1, Perception 0, Strength 1, and Willpower 3. Kate then has the option of switching two of her scores. She decides to swap Perception and Willpower, so she ends up with a Perception 3 and Willpower 0. <br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Ability Focuses </span> <br>A focus is an area of expertise within the larger abil¬ity. While Cunning as a whole determines how smart your character is, for example, a Heraldry focus would indicate a special knowledge of coats of arms and royal families. In game system terms, if you have a focus, your ability is effectively 2 higher than normal when work¬ing within that specialty. This is explained in greater detail in Chapter 6: Playingthe Game. <br>Ability focuses (or focuses for short) are one of the ways to make your character unique. There may be another warrior in your adventuring party, but your focuses can be completely different. You don’t need to worry about choosing focuses now; that happens later in the char¬acter creation process. Your character will get access to focuses through backgrounds, classes, and talents. For more information about ability focuses, see Chapter 3: Focuses and Talents.<br><br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Determining Abilities：</span><br>3d6 Roll &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StartingAbility <br>3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–2 <br>4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–1 <br>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–1 <br>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 <br>7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 <br>8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 <br>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <br>10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <br>11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <br>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <br>13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <br>14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <br>15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <br>16 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <br>17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <br>18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br><br>Set 1 includes the following focuses.

<div class="inner" id="msg_598274"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Backgrounds</span> <br>Your character did not spring from nothing. Just like real life, culture and upbringing shaped his or her per¬sonality and attributes. In Dragon Age you pick a back¬ground to represent these facets of your character and to determine your race. There are seven backgrounds to choose from: Apostate, Avvarian Hillsman, Circle Mage, City Elf, Dalish Elf, Fereldan Freeman, and Sur¬face Dwarf. <br>You should read over the following section and then pick the background you find most appealing or suit¬able for your character concept. The descriptions of the backgrounds will also give you a better sense of the setting and help you place your character within it. Choosing a background modifies your character in several ways. These are spelled out in each description, but generally include the following: <br>An increase to one or more of your abilities. • <br>One or more ability focuses. • <br>Determination of your race (dwarf, elf, or human). • <br>Determination of your class choices. • <br>The languages you can speak and read. • <br>Example <br>Now that Kate has rolled her abilities, it’s time to pick a background. She is drawn to city elf be¬cause of the injustice of elves’ treatment, and this works well with her character concept. She’s al¬ready thinking about how growing up in an alien¬age explains her character’s poor Constitution. The background increases her character’s Dexter¬ity by 1, making it an impressive 4. She can choose one of the two offered focuses, and settles on Perception (Seeing). She notes that she speaks the Trade Tongue, the most common language of Ferelden. She then must choose a class and has the option of playing a warrior or a rogue. With her character’s high Dexterity, she’s leaning toward rogue, but wants to read over the classes before deciding for sure. Lastly, she rolls on the city elf background table twice to get two more benefits. She gets a +1 to her Perception, which brings it up to 4, and gains another focus, Dexterity (Bows). <br></div>

This only got worse with the rise of the Chantry, as the new religion spoke out against magic as corrupt and evil. Magic, of course, was also quite useful, particularly when fighting creatures like darkspawn. This led to a compromise in which ma¬ges could legally practice magic—but only under the watchful eye of the Chantry. Blood magic, the practice of the dreaded maleficar, was also strictly forbidden. <br>During the second Blight the mages proved their worth and helped save humanity. This allowed them to gain a measure of autonomy, and thus was born the first Cir¬cle of Magi. While there are still Chantry Templars sta¬tioned in every Circle tower, it is the mages who police those with magical power. Circle mages find humans and elves with magical talent and bring them to their towers for training and supervision, and to teach them to defend themselves against demonic possession. Prac¬ticing magic outside a Circle is a capital offense.<br><br>Playing a Circle Mage <br>If you choose to play a Circle mage, modify your char¬acter as follows: <br>Add 1 to your Magic ability.

<div class="inner" id="msg_598279"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">City Elf </span><br>&nbsp;Over two millennia ago the elves and dwarves were the powers of Thedas. The elves ruled above the earth and the dwarves below it. The elves spent centuries be¬coming master magicians, craftsmen, and artists, and it is said they were nearly immortal. When humans first arrived in Thedas, the elves gave them aid despite what they considered impatient and rude behavior on the human’s part. The elves were shocked when dis¬<br>eases carried by the humans began killing them. They were horrified when they discovered that just being near humans shortened their lifespan and made them mortal. They attempted to shut themselves away from the rest of Thedas, but the rising Tevinter Imperium attacked them with its legions and its blood magic. The elf kingdom of Arlathan fell and the survivors spent the next 500 years as slaves of the Imperium. <br>When freedom did come, it was all to brief. The new elf homeland, the Dales, tried to revive the lost culture of Arlathan. That included worship of the ancient elven pantheon and this the Chantry would not tolerate. It declared an Exalted March against the Dales, accusing the elves of blood magic and practicing other forbidden rites, and for a second time the elves lost their home¬land. Some of the survivors became wanderers (see the Dalish Elf entry) but the rest were absorbed into the various human kingdoms. Here the so-called city elves still live as second class citizens, mostly working as ser¬vants and laborers. Few remember the culture of their heritage, fewer still can even speak elven any more, and almost none have a lifespan much longer than that of a human these days. They live in segregated sections of cities and towns known as alienages. Bitter and down¬trodden, many city elves turn to crime. These rogues, all too common, only reinforce the prejudice most hu¬mans have towards city elves.<br><br>City Elf <br>2d6 Roll &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefit <br>2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 Cunning<br>3-4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: Perception (Searching) <br>5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: Cunning(Evaluation) <br>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: Dexterity (Initiative) <br>7-8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 Perception <br>9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: Communication (Deception) <br>10-11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus: Dexterity (Bows) <br>12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+1 Communication<br><br>Playing a City Elf <br>If you choose to play a city elf, modify your character as follows: <br>Add 1 to your Dexterity ability.

While liberated humans and barbarians from the south took over former lands of the Imperium, the human leader Andraste gifted the elves a region of southern Orlais as a reward for their role in the rebellion. Here they established the Dales, a new elven homeland to replace the long-destroyed kingdom of Arlathan. Despite the centuries of slavery, the elves remembered much of their heritage and in the Dales their culture had a rebirth. As part of this they began to worship the ancient elven pantheon and this ultimately caused their downfall. The Chantry in the Orlesian Empire would not stand for such heresy and it declared an Exalted March against the Dales. A second elven homeland was destroyed and most of the survivors went to live in human lands and became the city elves. <br>The remaining leadership of the Dales would not bend a knee to the humans, however. They chose a life of<br>exile instead. These Dalish elves are descended from some of the oldest elven families and they retain a strong sense of duty to their people. They have taken it upon themselves to preserve elven culture and lore, so that when the day comes that the elves once again have a homeland they can teach the ancient ways to their city elf brethren. Until that time the Dalish elves wander in the ornately carved wagons they call aravel. Called landships by the humans, aravel are pulled by halla, a unique breed of white stag that originated in<br>long lost Arlathan. The Dalish elves travel in small fam¬ily groups for the most part and do not stay in one place for long. Rumor has it that they have rediscovered the secrets of elven magic, but if that is true no human has seen proof of it. <br>Playing a Dalish Elf <br>If you choose to play a Dalish elf, modify your charac¬ter as follows: <br>Add 1 to your Willpower ability.

They had many cities and settlements, all con¬nected by Deep Roads that ran far beneath the surface. Today only two dwarf cities remain: Orzammar in the Frostback Mountains and far-distant Kal Sharok. Both are waging an endless war against the darkspawn that conquered the old dwarven lands. While the two fortress-cities remain strong, dwarven numbers have been dwindling slowly for the past thousand years. For the most part Orzammer and Kal Sharok look inward. Dwarven society is rigid and caste-based and politics is notably vicious. <br>One caste stands apart from the others though: the sur¬face dwarves. They play a vital role but curiously other dwarves look down on them. Surface dwarves are large¬ly merchants and middlemen, trading goods and raw materials to humans and elves. They provide ore, gems, finely-forged steel, expertly-crafted goods, and the pre¬cious mineral lyrium. Dwarf adventurers and wanderers also belong to the Surface Caste. In Orzammer and Kal Sharok dwarves of this caste rank below all others except the casteless and the criminals.

<div class="inner" id="msg_598282"><span style="font-size: 24pt;" class="bbc_size">Classes </span> <br><br>If background is where you came from, class is what you’ve become. Classes are both mythic archetypes and frameworks for your character’s advancement. You have your choice of three: mage, rogue, and warrior. If you want a character that can cast spells, play a mage. If you want a character that is sneaky, play a rogue. If you want a character that can fight, play a warrior. <br>The classes are quite broad by design. A rogue could equally represent a thief with a penchant for burglary and a scout in a mercenary company. Your class helps define what your character can do, but it’s up to you to interpret how those capabilities fit with your character concept. <br>Example <br>Kate must now pick her class. After reading the descriptions, she goes with her first inclination and picks the rogue class. Since most city elves in Ferelden are poor, more than a few turn to crime. Kate decides that her character is going to buck that trend. She is going to take the rogue class, but use it to represent a sort of elven free¬dom fighter. Her character wants to liberate her people and give them a new homeland. Fight¬ing the power this way will require stealth and that makes rogue a good match. <br>Your character starts at level 1, which means that he’s a nov¬ice adventurer. As your character completes adventures and gains experience points, he’ll go up in level and get ac¬cess to new powers. This set provides information on class levels 1-5, while levels 6-20 are covered in Sets 2, 3, and 4. <br><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Class Descriptions </span> <br>Each class determines certain key features of your charac¬ter. A class description includes the following elements: <br>Primary Abilities: A class has three primary abilities. These are the abilities most important to the class and the ones used most often. <br>Secondary Abilities: A class has five secondary abilities. These abilities are not as important as primary abilities but all can be useful in the right circumstances. <br>StartingHealth: Health is a measure of your charac¬ter’s fitness and wellbeing. Class choice determines start¬ing Health. <br>Weapon Groups: Your class determines the weapons your character knows how to use. Weapons are divided into groups and this entry tells you which ones your character is trained in. For more information in weapons and weapon groups, see Chapter 4: Weapons and Gear. <br>Class Powers: A class provides your character with a variety of special powers, such as ability focuses and talents. These powers are listed out by level in each class description. <br></div>

<div class="inner" id="msg_598283"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Gaining Levels</span> <br><br><br>Your character gains experience points by overcoming challenges, surviving adventures, besting foes, and achiev¬ing goals. At the end of each adventure, your GM will award a certain number of experience points (abbreviated XP), which you need to track on your character sheet. The experience points required to attain each level are summa¬rized on the accompanying table. When your experience point total is high enough, your character gains a level. When this occurs, four things happen immediately: <br>Your character’s Health increases by • 1d6 + Constitution. <br>You may increase a single one of your character’s • abilities by 1. If you gained an even numbered level, you must increase a primary ability. If you gained an odd numbered level, you must increase a secondary ability. <br>You can pick one new ability focus. If you gained • an even numbered level, you must choose a focus from one of your primary abilities. If you gained an odd numbered level, you must choose a focus from one of your secondary abilities. <br>You gain the class powers for your new level. You • can find them in the class description.<br><br>Level Advancement <br>XP Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level <br>0-1,999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 <br>2,000-4,499 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 <br>4,500-7,499 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 <br>7,500-10,999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 <br>11,000-14,999 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5<br><br>Example <br>At the end of her most recent adventure, Kate’s character receives enough experience points to make it to level 2. First, she rolls to add to her Health. She gets a 4, subtracts 1 for her poor Con¬stitution, and ends up gaining 3 Health. Second, she adds 1 to her Dexterity, making it 5. She had her choice of Communication, Dexterity, or Per¬ception (the rogue’s primary abilities) and decided pumping her Dexterity was the best option at this level. Third, she takes Communication (Investiga¬tion) as a new ability focus. She could have cho¬sen any focus from Communication, Dexterity, or Perception. Lastly, she gains a stunt bonus as her class power for becoming a level 2 rogue. <br>The GM hands out XP based on how the PCs handled themselves in the encounters of the adventure. The rules for experience points are in the Game Master’s Guide.<br><br></div>

<div class="inner" id="msg_598285"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Mage</span><br>&nbsp;<br>There is magic in all living things. While every elf, dwarf, hu¬man, animal, and plant is permeated with magic, only a rare few beings can manipulate it. The mage class represents these users of magic. They have been gifted (or cursed, depending on your point of view) with the ability to absorb mana, the life force of living beings, and use it cast magical spells. This sets them apart from normal people. In some times and places, mages have been honored for their power and wisdom. In others they have been feared and hunted, especially once the dangers of demonic pos¬session were understood. Blood magic, as prac¬ticed by the mages of Tevinter and the maleficar, has also made mages widely feared. <br>The mage class represents users of magic in Thedas, most commonly from the Circle of Magi but sometimes the renegade apos¬tates. A mage is capable of amazing feats, but must be wary of demonic attack when using powerful magic. The very gift that allows mages to use magic also makes them vulner¬able to possession. <br>As a mage you will be a master of arcane powers. You should stay away from melee combat (let warriors handle that) and use your spells to help your allies and harm your enemies. Mages generally don’t wear armor, so your Defense will be low. You also have lim¬ited access to weaponry. Your access to spells makes up for these limitations, though. You get access to many different spells; a mage who masters their use is a powerful character. <br>While mages only start with three spells, they gain more over time. These ever-increasing options require more decision making than other classes during encounters. If you’ve never played an RPG before, you might want to consider that before choos¬ing this class. Whatever your experi¬ence, you’ll want to read Chapter 5: Magic to learn more about the rules and terms used in spell casting. <br>Primary Abilities<br>Cunning, Magic, and Willpower. <br>Secondary Abilities<br>Communication, Constitution, Dexterity, Perception, and Strength. <br>Starting Health <br>20 + Constitution + 1d6. <br>WeaponGroups<br>Brawlingand Staves. <br>Class Powers <br>Mages gain the following powers at the specified level. <br>Level1 <br>Arcane Lance: Mages learn to focus magical power through a staff or wand. If you are holding a quarterstaff or a wand, you can make a special ranged attack that damages foes with a lance of magical energy. This is resolved like a normal ranged attack (so stunts are possible), but the attack roll is a Magic (Arcane Lance) test. An arcane lance has a range of 16 yards and inflicts 1d6 + Magic damage. It requires no mana points to make this attack. <br>Magic Training: This is the most important of the mage’s powers. It allows a mage to cast the spells that are the hall¬mark of the class. Magic training gives you three spells to start with, and you can gain more through talents and class pow¬ers. See Chapter 5: Magic for more information about choos¬ing and casting spells. <br>ManaPoints: You use mana to power your spells. You start with a number of mana points equal to 10 + Magic + 1d6 and you gain Magic + 1d6 more whenever you gain a new level. You must keep track of your current mana points; this is a measure of how much magical power is at your command at any given time. You spend mana points when you cast spells; you can regain them through rest and meditation. See Chapter 5: Magic for details. <br>StartingTalent: You become a novice in one of the following talents: Chiru¬rgy, Linguistics, or Lore. See Chapter 3: Focuses and Talents for more in¬formation. <br>Level2 <br>New Spell: You gain one new spell. <br>Level3 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you already have. <br>Level4 <br>New Spell: You gain one new spell. <br>Spell Lance: You can cast a spell after hitting a foe with an arcane lance. This is a stunt that costs 3 stunt points, and the spell you cast cannot have a mana point cost greater than 3. A casting roll is required as usual. For more information about stunts, see Chapter 6: Playingthe Game. <br>Level5 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you al¬ready have.<br><br></div>

<div class="inner" id="msg_598287"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Rogue</span><br>&nbsp;<br>The rogue class represents the classic trickster. You can use this class to represent a thief, scoun¬drel, or conman, or a scout, expert, or spy. While a warrior gets by on brute strength and a mage on arcane power, a rogue relies on quickness and cleverness. Whether engaging in witty repar¬tee or slipping a dagger between an enemy’s ribs, a rogue must be artful to win the day. <br>As a rogue you are the eyes and ears of your adventuring group. You are excel¬lent at ranged combat and can launch devastating melee attacks with your backstab ability. You are not, how¬ever, a true frontline fighter. Your Defense will be good due to your Dexterity, but your light armor means you can’t absorb a lot of damage. Let the warriors go toe to toe with the ene¬my while you use stealth and sur¬prise to keep them off balance. <br>The rogue is the most open-ended of the classes. If you aren’t sure where you want to go with your character, rogue is a good choice, as the class provides the flexibility to develop in many directions. <br>Primary Abilities<br>Communication, Dexterity, and Perception. <br>Secondary Abilities<br>Constitution, Cunning, Magic, Strength, and Willpower. <br>Starting Health <br>25 + Constitution + 1d6. <br>WeaponGroups<br>Bows, Brawling, Light Blades, Staves. <br><span style="font-size: 12pt;" class="bbc_size">Class Powers </span> <br>Rogues gain the following powers at the specified level. <br>Level1 <br>Backstab: You can inflict extra damage with a melee attack if you can strike an opponent from an unexpected direction. You must approach your opponent with a move action and win an opposed test of your Dexterity (Stealth) vs. your target’s Perception (Seeing). If you win the test, you can use your major action this round to back¬stab him. This is a melee attack with a +2 bonus to the attack roll that inflicts +1d6 extradamage. You cannot backstab an enemy that you begin your turn adjacent to (but see the Bluff power at level 4). <br>Rogue’s Armor: You are at home in leather armor. You can ignore the Armor Penalty of leather armor altogether. It affects neither your Speed nor your Dexterity. <br>StartingTalents: You become a novice in one of the following talents: Con¬tacts, Scouting, or Thievery. See Chap¬ter 3: Focuses and Talents for more information. <br>Level2 <br>Stunt Bonus: You become more adept at finding the weak spots in your opponents’ armor. You can perform the Pierce Armor stunt for 1 SP instead of the usual 2. <br>Level3 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you already have. <br>Level4 <br>Bluff: You can try to backstab an opponent that you begin your turn adjacent to. You must first use a minor action to try to deceive him. This is an opposed test of your Communication (Deception) vs. your opponent’s Willpower (Self-Discipline). If you win, you have wrong-footed your oppo¬nent and can backstab him. As usual with a backstab, you make a melee attack with a +2 bonus and inflict +1d6 extra damage if you hit. <br>Level5 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you already have. <br>“If it can go wrong, it will. That’s why you always need to have an escape route ready, whether you’re burgling a house or fighting in battle. And don’t be afraid to run when you’re in a bad spot. You want to control the situation, not the other way round. If you duel a knight, you’re fighting on his terms. Let him huff and puff in his heavy armor while you fill him full of arrows. That’s how you stay alive.” <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galen the Swift, Rogue<br></div>

<div class="inner" id="msg_598289"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Warrior</span> <br>&nbsp;<br>The warrior is the classic fighting man. You can use this class to represent any kind martial character. Your charac¬ter could be an ex-soldier, a caravan guard, a mercenary, a militiaman, or a former blacksmith turned adventurer. A warrior may fight for honor, revenge, justice, money, or a better tomorrow. Some members of the warrior class have received formal training and others fight by instinct; all can handle themselves in a fight. <br>As a warrior you’ll usually find yourself in the thick of combat. You have access to heavier armor and more weapons than members of any other class, and you can dish out and take a lot of damage. It is often up to you to engage the hard¬est-hitting enemies, so the rogues and mages of the group have the chance to use their abilities. <br>If you’ve never played a tabletop RPG before, the warrior is a good class to start with. Your powers are straightforward and you have plenty to do in any combat encounter. <br>Primary Abilities<br>Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength <br>Secondary Abilities<br>Communication, Cunning, Magic, Perception, and Willpower <br>Starting Health <br>30 + Constitution + 1d6 <br>WeaponGroups<br>Brawling, plus any three of the following: Axes, Blud¬geons, Bows, Heavy Blades, Light Blades, Spears, or Staves. <br>Class Powers <br>Warriors gain the following powers at the specified level. <br>Level1 <br>StartingTalents: You become a novice in two of the following talents: Archery Style, Dual Weapon Style, Single Weapon Style, Throwing Weapon Style, Two-Hander Style, or Weapon and Shield Style. You also start as a novice in Armor Training. <br>Level2 <br>New Ability Focus: You now gain one of the following ability focuses: Cunning(Military Lore), Dexterity (Riding), or Strength (Climbing). <br>Level3 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you already have. <br>Level4 <br>New Weapon Group: You learn a new weapon group of your choice. <br>Stunt Bonus: You can strike so fast in combat that your weap¬ons are a blur. You can perform the Dual Strike stunt for 3 stunt points instead of the usual 4. <br>Level5 <br>New Talent: You become a novice in a new talent or gain a degree in a talent you already have. <br>“When the chaos of battle begins, you must keep your wits. If you panic, you’ll die with a spear in the back. And don’t go charging off on your own like a wild Avvar. The enemy will surround you and bring you down. No, it’s discipline and teamwork that win battles. You must fight together or you will die alone.” <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torr of House Strakan, Warrior<br><br><br></div>

<div class="inner" id="msg_598290"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Equipment </span> <br>Player characters do not start their adventures with much to their names. In play your character will have a chance to get better equipment but must start with the basics. Think of better gear as something to aspire to. <br>Characters begin play with the following: <br>A backpack. • <br>Traveler’s garb. • <br>A waterskin. • <br>If you are a mage, you get one weapon and a • wand (for your arcane lance). <br>If you are a rogue, you get light leather armor and • two weapons. <br>If you are a warrior, you get heavy leather armor • and three weapons. <br>If you choose a bow or crossbow, you get a quiver • and 20 arrows or bolts. <br>If you have the Weapon and Shield talent, you get • a medium shield. <br>Make sure to pick weapons from weapon groups your character knows. Otherwise, you’ll suffer penalties when you wield them, and there will be little point in carrying the weapons around. Also remember that some weapons have a minimum Strength requirement, so be sure your character is strong enough before pick¬ing something like a two-handed sword. You’ll also want to write down your armor’s Armor Rating on your character record sheet. This is a measure of the armor’s protection and you’ll need to know that during combat. <br>Your character also gets 50 + 3d6 silver pieces to buy additional gear. You’ll find a complete list of available items in Chapter 4: Weapons and Gear.<br><br><br>Example <br>Kate is ready to outfit her rogue. She writes on her character sheet that she has a backpack, traveler’s garb, and a waterskin. As a rogue, she starts with light leather armor and two weap¬ons. She can choose anything from the rogue’s weapon groups: Bows, Brawling, Light Blades, Staves. She decides to take a short bow and a short sword, so she can make both ranged and melee attacks. Since she took a bow, she also gets a quiver and 20 arrows. She then rolls 3d6 and gets 12. That means she starts with 62 silver (50 + 12). She spends 15 of that on a light shield for when things get up close and personal. She also spends 2 silver on 20 yards of rope. That leaves her with 45 silver as the campaign begins, so she has some resources for food, lodging, bribes, etc.<br><br></div>

<div class="post">
<div class="inner" id="msg_598292"><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Defense and Speed </span> <br>There are two final numbers you need to calculate for your character: Defense and Speed. <br>Defense measures how hard it is to hit your character in combat. The higher the Defense, the better. You calcu¬late Defense as follows: <br>Defense = 10 + Dexterity + shield bonus (if applicable) <br>Shield bonuses are explained in Chapter 4: Weapons and Gear. For the moment, you just need to know that light shields have a +1 bonus and mediums shield a +2 bonus. <br>Example <br>Kate now calculates her rogue’s Defense. With her Dexterity of 4, her Defense is 14 (10 + 4). If she equips her light shield, it rises to 15. <br>Speed measures gait and quickness of foot. Basically, your character can move up to a number of yards equal to Speed when taking a move action. This is explained in greater detail in Chapter 6: Playingthe Game. You calculate Speed as follows: <br>Dwarf Speed = 8 + Dexterity – armor penalty (if applicable) <br>Elf Speed = 12 + Dexterity – armor penalty (if applicable) <br>Human Speed = 10 + Dexterity – armor penalty (if applicable) <br>Most suits of armor have a penalty that represents their weight and bulk; this naturally slows characters down some. You can learn more about this in Chapter 4: Weapons and Gear. For the moment, you just need to know that light leather armor has no penalty and heavy leather armor has a –1 penalty. <br>Example <br>Kate is ready to calculate her rogue’s speed. Since her character is an elf, she takes a base of 12 and adds her Dexterity of 4 for a total Speed of 16 (12 + 4 = 16). Her light leather armor has no armor penalty, so Speed 16 it is. Kate’s rogue is quite light in the feet.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Names </span> <br>What is a character without a name? Although this step is towards the end of the character creation process, it should not be an afterthought. The right name can be that little something that sums up who the character<br>is or wants to be. This section contains some naming guidelines for different cultures in Dragon Age and some example names for both sexes. Do feel free to make up your own names in the same style, but try to avoid silly name syndrome (Orf the Dwarf, for example). This is a dark fantasy game after all. <br>Avvarian Names <br>The hillsmen are divided into clans, each is which is centered on a settlement called a hold. The settlement and the clan are so intertwined that they share the same name, so the seat of Clan Craghold is Craghold. Av¬var names have three parts: first name, byname, and clan name. The clans are matrilineal (as they say, one’s mother is obvious to all), so the byname indicates an Avvar’s mother by use of “An” (daughter of) or “Ar” (son of) in front of the mother’s name. This is followed by “O” and then the clan name. Here’s a complete ex¬ample of an Avvar name: Arcill Ar Dubne O Wyrm¬hold. So Arcill is the son of Dunbe and they belong to the Clan Wyrmhold. <br>Sample Female Names: Annis, Cathal, Deirde, Ete, Bethac, Grissall, Kattrin, Muire, Ninne, Swannac. <br>Sample Male Names: Arcill, Colban, Domnall, Dubne, Garnait, Martain, Nechtan, Padraig, Sithig, Tralin. <br>Sample Clan Names: Bearhold, Craghold, Falconhold, Frosthold, Helmhold, Peakhold, Redhold, Spearhold, Stormhold, Wyrmhold. <br>Dwarven Names <br>Dwarven society is made up of houses, each of which comprises a group of families. A dwarf has a given name and a house name. The house name is sometimes used as a last name and sometimes as part of a title. A dwarf might call himself Bhelen Aeducan or Bhelen of House Aeducan, for example, depending on the situation. <br>Sample Female Names: Althild, Branka, Ethelwid, Hil¬dred, Jarvia, Kedwalla, Milburga, Orta, Peada, Sigge. <br>Sample Male Names: Eadrek, Gorim, Kerdik, Kynewulf, Legnar, Oerik, Oswulf, Roshek, Vengest, Witred. <br>Sample House Names: Azagale, Drizcole, Dunnharg, Griskin, Korkill, Kitrik, Moratin, Nevvin, Strakan, Tranador. <br>Elven Names <br>City elves follow the Fereldan standard and have but one name. Dalish elves generally only identify them¬selves by first name as well, but they also have a clan name that is used in formal situations. Dalish clan names generally correspond to the noble houses of the Dales that they descend from.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Sample Female Names: Adanna, Ashalle, Desta, Elora, Hanan, Maram, Lanaya, Ranalle, Shinasha, Unathe. <br>Sample Male Names: Athras, Falos, Harel, Lindel, Masarian, Nethras, Pellian, Ralath, Sarel, Zathrian. <br>Sample Dalish Clan Names: Alvar, Brightmore, Brunwyn, Ellwood, Fadrick, Goldhawk, Litwyn, Redway, Winbow, Yonwyn. <br>Fereldan Names <br>Most people in Ferelden have only one name. They may identify themselves by trade (Jannelle the Baker) or by their place of origins (Darrahn of Highever) if needed. True last names are reserved for the nobility. <br>Sample Female Names: Afton, Demelza, Edlyn, Kelsie, Locke, Radella, Seldon, Sherey, Tayte, Ulla. <br>Sample Male Names: Ackley, Blaen, Calder, Elden, Garrick, Landon, Marden, Oswin, Rylan, Tranter. <br>Example <br>Kate’s character is a city elf and they typically have but one name. Though some have elven names, others try to fit in by giving their children more common Fereldan names. Kate decides her character was named Locke, but that a cruel hu¬man mistress took to calling her Lack instead. <br>Goals and Ties <br>Now your character is almost ready to go. Before you jump into your first adventure, though, take a few minutes to think about your character’s goals and what ties you might have to other characters in the group. Even if you’ve made your character on your own, it’s a good idea to take these last steps together. Setting up goals and ties as a group allows you to riff off each other and come up with ideas that are com¬plementary. <br>Goals <br>Your character can have any number of goals, but try to come up with at least three. Goals usually have some¬thing to do with why your character became an adven¬turer in the first place. It’s not a common calling after all, and certainly not a safe one. These driving forces often translate into one or more goals. <br>When making your list, try to come up with a mix of short- and long-term goals. Short-term goals are things you want to focus on now, and long-term goals are of a size and scope that may require years or even decades of struggle. A good GM will take your goals into ac¬count when running the game, and the more info the GM has to work with, the better. <br>So what makes a good goal? Two things. First, a good goal should help define your character by making ex¬plicit what is important to him. Second, it should pro¬vide story hooks that other players and the GM can grab and use in play. <br>Example <br>Kate is nearly finished with Locke. At the first ses¬sion of the campaign, she gets together with her group to finalize their characters. Kate decides that a good short-term goal is that Locke wants to find her missing brother. He left the alienage on a mys¬terious mission and never returned. Locke’s next goal is to learn the elven language. Few city elves speak it anymore and she wants to reconnect with her heritage. Lastly, she picks a long-term goal of destroying the alienages and finding a new home¬land for her people. She may not see this in her lifetime but she will strive to make it a reality. <br><br><span style="font-size: 18pt;" class="bbc_size">Ties </span> <br>The classic RPG set-up has the group meeting up in a tavern and embarking on a series of death-defying quests together despite being virtual strangers. That sort of approach can work if you are developing the characters as the campaign goes on. The group’s cohe¬sion will be stronger, however, if the characters start with some ties. It doesn’t mean that all the characters need to know each other before play begins, but they should have some connections. Characters might have grown up in the same village, served in the same mili¬tary unit, or even been romantic rivals. Or maybe they are distant cousins, chased by a shared enemy, or in debt to the same underworld figure. <br>You should try to come up with at least one tie for each other player character, even if it’s a tenuous one. The group bond will grow over time but it’s a good idea to plant the seed early so it can grow. <br>Example <br>The other players in Kate’s group are Gloria, who is playing a Ferelden warrior named Ulla, and Keegan, who is playing a circle mage named Oswald. Gloria was intrigued by Locke’s goal to find her missing brother. She decides that Ulla’s best friend also left home and never returned. Ulla found out that Locke’s brother was on the same journey and tracked down Locke to see if she knew any more. Keegan decides that Oswald has but slight connections with the other char¬acters. Locke was briefly a servant in his Circle tower (perhaps they share a secret from this time?) and Ulla served as bodyguard for some of his Circle’s mages. With that finished, they are ready to play!<br></div>
