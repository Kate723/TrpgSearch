Ahroun Gifts<br>While all Garou are Gaia’s warriors, the Ahroun are <br>the fighters among fighters. Burning with the gift of Luna’s <br>Rage, Ahroun channel their righteous fury into terrible <br>weapons or cunning leadership on the battlefield.<br>• Falling Touch (Level One) — This Gift allows the <br>Garou to send her foe sprawling with but a touch. Any <br>aerial spirit can teach this Gift.<br>System: The player rolls Willpower (difficulty of the <br>opponent’s Stamina + Athletics). Even one success sends <br>the victim to the ground. This Gift may be employed <br>through even the lightest, brushing contact at no cost, or <br>may be delivered through an attack by paying one point <br>of Willpower or Rage. Such attacks inflict full damage in <br>addition to knocking the target prone.<br>•&nbsp; Inspiration (Level One) — Other werewolves look <br>to the Ahroun for leadership in battle, and this Gift helps <br>them to live up to that trust. The werewolf employs this <br>Gift to lend her resolve and righteous anger to those who <br>share her cause. A lion- or wolf-spirit teaches it.<br>System: The player spends one Gnosis point. All <br>comrades (but not the Gift’s user) receive one Willpower <br>point, which disappears if it is not used before the end <br>of the scene.<br>• Pack Tactics (Level One) — While the Ahroun’s <br>role as the overall leader of Garou is questionable, there’s <br>no doubt at all who should take control of the pack in <br>battle. By taking the lead and coordinating pack actions, <br>the Ahroun gifts all her packmates with great competence <br>in the heat of battle. A wolf-spirit teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends a Willpower point before <br>initiating a Pack Tactics maneuver&nbsp; (see p. 300) and divides <br>a pool of extra dice equal to her Leadership score among <br>everyone performing the maneuver. The dice should be <br>divided as evenly as possible, although the player may <br>choose where to distribute extra dice (or in case of the <br>Ahroun’s Leadership score granting fewer dice than the <br>number of packmates involved).<br>• Razor Claws (Level One) — By raking his claws <br>over stone, steel, or some other hard surface, the were-<br>wolf hones them to razor sharpness. A cat- or bear-spirit <br>teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends one Rage point and the <br>Ahroun takes a full turn sharpening her claws. All claw <br>attacks do two additional dice of damage and are made <br>at –1 difficulty for the rest of the scene.<br>• Spur Claws (Level One) — In ancient times, Ah-<br>roun warriors made common cause with the spirit-Queen <br>of Bees. As her own hive-children rallied to protect her, <br>so too did the Garou fight in defense of Gaia, and the <br>Queen decreed that they should be properly equipped for <br>the fight. This Gift, taught by a bee-spirit in recognition <br>of that alliance, allows the Ahroun to transform her claws <br>into hooked and barbed spurs.<br>System: The player spends one Rage. The next success-<br>ful claw attack the character makes buries her claws into <br>the victim, where they stick after breaking free from the <br>werewolf ’s fingertips. Until the victim takes the time to pull <br>them out (which takes a full turn), they suffer +2 difficulty to <br>all actions. The Garou’s claws take a full turn to regenerate.<br>• Sense Silver (Level Two) — As the metis Gift.<br>• Shield of Rage (Level Two) — Such is the Rage <br>burning within an Ahroun’s heart that all lesser furies <br>quail before it. A wolverine-spirit teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends one Willpower point. For <br>the rest of the scene, all spirits’ Rage scores are considered <br>two less than their real values for the purpose of rolling <br>damage against the Ahroun.<br>• Spirit of the Fray (Level Two) — A cat-spirit <br>grants the Ahroun the Gift of blinding speed and lightning <br>reflexes, permitting her to strike before any foe.<br>System: Once the Ahroun learns this Gift, its effects <br>are permanent. She adds 10 to all her initiative rolls, and <br>if she chooses, may spend a Gnosis point to add another <br>10 to an initiative roll (such an expenditure prevents <br>spending Rage for extra actions, however).<br>• True Fear (Level Two) — The werewolf displays <br>his full, terrifying might — baring teeth or claws, howling, <br>or simply looming ominously over a foe. Terror strikes one <br>foe into quiescence. Spirits of fear teach this Gift.<br>System: The player rolls Strength + Intimidation <br>(difficulty equal to the target’s Willpower). Each success <br>cows the enemy for one turn; the victim cannot attack <br>during this time, but may defend himself and otherwise <br>act normally (although his actions are likely guided by <br>overwhelming terror).<br>• Combat Healing (Level Three) — This Gift allows <br>the werewolf to mend his injuries without rest or hesita-<br>tion — even in the heart of combat — as claws and bullets <br>tear fresh rents in his flesh. While other Garou struggle <br>to mend their wounds under fire, the Ahroun never stops <br>fighting. Elemental spirits teach this Gift, although they <br>must generally be bested in battle first.<br>System: The Ahroun no longer needs to pause or <br>roll Stamina to heal during combat, and automatically <br>regenerates one non-aggravated health level every round. <br>This benefit is permanent.<br>• Heart of Fury (Level Three) — The Garou steels <br>himself against anger, suppressing his Rage and creating <br>a mental wall to hold back the tide of righteous fury that <br>threatens to drown him. The anger always returns, how-<br>ever, and the Garou had best be ready to pay its bill. A <br>boar-spirit teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player rolls Willpower (difficulty equals <br>the character’s permanent Rage). Every two successes add <br>+1 to the character’s frenzy difficulties for the scene, making <br>it harder to frenzy. When the scene ends, past slights and <br>injuries come rushing back to haunt the werewolf, refilling <br>his heart and soul. He must spend one Willpower point <br>or make an immediate frenzy check at regular difficulty.<br>• Silver Claws (Level Three) — Luna sends her <br>children to teach this powerful but painful Gift to those <br>warriors who gain her favor. When invoked, it transforms <br>the werewolf ’s claws into silver.<br>System: The player rolls Gnosis (difficulty 7) to <br>activate this Gift. Silver claws inflict aggravated damage <br>to all targets, and are naturally unsoakable to Garou and <br>most other Fera. The Ahroun suffers searing agony while <br>manifesting these silver claws. Each turn, she gains an <br>automatic Rage point, and all non-combat difficulties <br>increase by one because of the distraction. On each turn <br>that her Rage points exceed her Willpower, she must <br>check for frenzy. The Gift lasts for one scene, unless the <br>Garou takes a turn to voluntarily end it sooner.<br>• Wind Claws (Level Three) — The Ahroun’s <br>claws and fangs pass through the flimsy protections of <br>their enemies as though they were but air and hope. An <br>air elemental teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends one Rage point. For the <br>rest of the turn, all of the Ahroun’s attacks completely <br>ignore any armor (mundane or magical) that targets <br>might be wearing; the targets forfeit all soak dice from <br>such protection.<br>• Body Shift (Level Four) — As the homid Gift.<br>• Clenched Jaw (Level Four) — The werewolf bites <br>down with such power that her grip won’t loosen until she <br>chooses to let it; even in death, her jaws remain locked. <br>A wolf- or hyena-spirit teaches this Gift.<br>System: After making a successful bite attack, the <br>player may spend a Rage point to invoke this Gift. For <br>each successive turn she chooses to maintain her grip, <br>she makes a bite attack roll (difficulty 3). While foes can <br>make a resisted Strength roll to break the grip (suffering <br>an additional health level of damage in the process of try-<br>ing to tear free), the Garou may add half her Willpower <br>to her dice pool (round up).<br>• Full Moon’s Light (Level Four) — The full moon <br>is Luna’s warrior phase, when she searches out her enemies. <br>The Ahroun can call upon her determination in finding her <br>foes, illuminating any who oppose her. Lunes teach this Gift.<br>System: The player spends one Gnosis point. For the <br>remainder of the scene, anyone within one mile who is <br>working against the Ahroun or her pack emits a soft glow, <br>as though illuminated by moonlight. This Gift can be used <br>to confound powers of stealth or even invisibility, but only <br>if the target is actively attempting to harm, compete with, <br>or otherwise foil the Ahroun or her pack.<br>• Stoking Fury’s Furnace (Level Four) — This Gift <br>allows the Garou to husband his Rage, keeping it burning <br>for as long as Gaia’s enemies remain to be defeated. A <br>wolverine-spirit teaches it.<br>System: This Gift’s effects are permanent. The were-<br>wolf regains one Rage point during any turn in which he <br>takes damage. This Rage does not cause a frenzy check, <br>though other sources will induce checks as usual. Ad-<br>ditionally, the player can spend one Rage point per turn <br>without losing any temporary Rage. If multiple Rage points <br>are spent during any turn, however, all are marked off.<br>• Kiss of Helios (Level Five) — The Ahroun can <br>invoke the sun’s power to gain immunity to flame. Ad-<br>ditionally, she may ignite any portion of her body and <br>keep it burning as she desires. Garou with this Gift are as <br>likely to light their mane to honor the sun during rituals <br>as they are to ignite their claws or fangs in battle. A fire <br>elemental or sun-spirit teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends one Gnosis. For the rest <br>of the scene, the character is unharmed by any natural <br>source of flames or heat. Artificial (napalm, gas fires, etc.) <br>and supernatural flames can inflict no more than a single <br>level of bashing damage during a turn. The character <br>inflicts two additional dice of aggravated damage with <br>burning attacks.<br>• Strength of Will (Level Five) — A werewolf with <br>this Gift is a pillar of indomitable will. He can share this <br>terrifying strength with others as well, leading them through <br>the gates of Malfeas without a moment’s fear or hesitation. <br>A wolf-spirit or an Incarna avatar teaches this Gift.<br>System: The player spends a point of Willpower and <br>rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty 8). Each success <br>grants all the Garou’s allies within 100 feet (and her <br>packmates anywhere within 100 miles) an extra point of <br>Willpower. The extra points last for the rest of the scene <br>and may raise an ally’s Willpower above its maximum (and <br>even above 10). This Gift can only be used once per scene.<br>• Unstoppable Warrior (Level Six) — The werewolf <br>with this potent Gift may shrug off even flames and the <br>claws of his own kind. A warrior Incarna teaches this Gift.<br>System: The Garou becomes permanently capable <br>of healing all aggravated damage as though it were lethal <br>damage, save for wounds inflicted by silver.
